  abstract   = {The aggregate motion of a flock of birds, a herd of land animals, or a school of fish is a beautiful and familiar part of the natural world. But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

  abstract  = {The paper presents a radically new approach to real-time dynamic control and active force control of manipulators. In this approach the manipulator control problem is reformulated in terms of direct control of manipulator motion in operational space, the space in which the task is originally described, rather than controlling the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained after geometric and kinematic transformation. The control method is based on the construction of the manipulator end effector dynamic model in operational space. Also, the paper presents a unique real-time obstacle avoidance method for manipulators and mobile robots based on the ``artificial potential field'' concept. In this method, collision avoidance, traditionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, allowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. Using a time-varying artificial potential field, this technique has been extended to moving obstacles. A two-level control architecture has been designed to increase the system real-time performance. These methods have been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot arm. We have demonstrated compliance, contact, sliding, and insertion operations using wrist and finger sensing, as well as real-time collision avoidance with moving obstacles using visual sensing.},

  abstractnote = {This paper presents a method for robot motion planning in dynamic environments. It consists of selecting avoidance maneuvers to avoid static and moving obstacles in the velocity space, based on the current positions and velocities of the robot and obstacles. It is a first-order method, since it does not integrate velocities to yield positions as functions of time. The avoidance maneuvers are generated by selecting robot velocities outside of the velocity obstacles, which represent the set of robot velocities that would result in a collision with a given obstacle that moves at a given velocity, at some future time. To ensure that the avoidance maneuver is dynamically feasible, the set of avoidance velocities is intersected with the set of admissible velocities, defined by the robot`s acceleration constraints. computing new avoidance maneuvers at regular time intervals accounts for general obstacle trajectories. The trajectory from start to goal is computed by searching a tree of feasible avoidance maneuvers, computed at discrete time intervals. An exhaustive search of the tree yields near-optimal trajectories that either minimize distance or motion time. A heuristic search of the tee is applicable to on-line planning. The method is demonstrated for point and disk robots among static and moving obstacles, and for an automated vehicle in an intelligent vehicle highway system scenario.},

  abstract = {Running time, flexibility and on-line adaptation are important features presenting to the decision making (DM) module of soccer robots. In this paper, the design of DM algorithm based on behaviour trees and fuzzy obstacle avoidance algorithm for control of soccer robots are presented. The basic elements of the behaviour tree (BT) used in decision making process of soccer robots are described. The integration of BT and fuzzy logic is proposed to increase the flexibility of the decision made by DM modules. Given algorithms have been extensively tested in simulation and provided satisfactory results in run time and adaptation to the new situation. Also, the efficient navigation procedure is designed using fuzzy obstacle avoidance algorithm. The obstacle avoidance algorithm uses fuzzy if-then rule base and inference mechanism for finding optimal path for avoidance of obstacles. The presented BT based decision making and fuzzy obstacle avoidance algorithms are used for control of the holonomic 4-wheel-driven soccer robots. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms in soccer robot control.}
